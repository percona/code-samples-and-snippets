# Code Samples and Snippets

The repository contains code samples that are used in blog articles, social media, and videos.

In other words, if you're preparing an article or video where you want to use a reference to sample code, we recommend publishing that code in this shared repository instead of personal GitHub repositories.

It is expected that this repository will be maintained for a long period of time and used by different authors.

We suggest several categories to structure code examples:

- products
- databases
- authors
- other

You can create individual files or group them into separate subfolders within categories.

For example:

`/authors/dbazhenov/dashboard_app/docker-compose.yaml`

`/databases/mysql/percona-blog/article-title/my.cnf`

`/products/kubetnetes-operators/dev-to/article-title/backup-s3.yaml`

We recommend adding README.md to the directories you create with a description and a link to the place where this code is used.

We would welcome your suggestions for structure. Just create an Issue with your suggestions.

Please make changes via separate branches and Pull Request.
